HISTORY:

1970- Saul B. Needleman and Chirstian D. Wuncsh-> Proposed the Needleman-Wunsh algorithm for global alignment. "Iterative calculation of a matrix for the porpuse of showing global alignment" O(mn).

1976- Waterman added the concepts of gaps.

1981- Smith and Waterman published algorithm for local alignment O(mÂ²n).

Gotoh and Atschul optimized th algorithm to O(mn).

Myers and Miller optimezed to O(n) linear complexity. 


MOTIVATION:

- Genome projects generated massive amount of sequence data for genes and proteins.
- Seuquence alignments shows the relations between genes or between proteins. Can also reveal conserved domains and motifs.
